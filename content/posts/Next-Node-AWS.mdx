# How to Deploy Next.js and Node.js Applications in Docker Containers on AWS EC2

## Pre-assumptions:

You already know how to set up and create web applications with Next.js, Node.js and Express.

_This is NOT a walkthrough on how to create a Next.js and Node.js application; though you can look more online for a tutorial if you need._

Preferred, but not essential - familiar with AWS, EC2 and Docker. Will delve into each, but nor is this a detailed deep look into them.

Deploying a modern web application can seem challenging, but with a structured approach, you can deploy a Next.js (client-side) and Node.js (server-side) application on AWS EC2 using Docker without too much hassle. A troubleshooting guide is at the end of this piece if you run into issues.
This guide walks you through the process step-by-step.

---

## Phase 1: Prepare Your Code

### 1. Set Up Client-Side with Next.js

- Create your Next.js app:

  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest
  ```

- Install your dependencies and create your env vars in env.local

### 2. Set Up Server side with Node.js and Express

You may wish to go the route of a static generated build, for this demo, have gone for SSR.

Create your server directory and initialize a Node.js app:

- Create your Node.js app:

  ```bash
  mkdir server
  cd server
  npm init -y
  ```

- Install necessary dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install express dotenv
  ```

- Set up the main server file (e.g., server.js):

  ```bash
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
   res.send('Node.js server is running');
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
   console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
  ```

- From here build out the rest of your Node.js app

## Phase 2: Set Up AWS

### 3. Sign Up for AWS Free Tier

- Create an AWS account at AWS Free Tier.
- Verify your email and details.

### 4. Configure EC2 for AWS

- Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard and launch an instance:
- Select Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu as the AMI.
- Choose the t2.micro instance type (free tier eligible).
- Set up and download key pair _for tutorial purposes, we will call this **my-app-key**_
- Configure security groups:
- Allow inbound traffic for SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and custom ports 3000 and 4000 (or whatever ports you have set for your client and server).

**Key Pair Creation Options:**

- Name your key pair (e.g., "my-ec2-key")
- Choose file format:

- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pem (OpenSSH, Linux/Mac)
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ppk (PuTTY, Windows)

### 5. Set Up AWS CLI

Install AWS CLI on your local machine:

```bash
 curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
 sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
 aws --version
```

### 6. Configure AWS CLI to EC2 Instance

Configure your AWS credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

- Enter your AWS access key, secret key, default region, and output format (JSON).

**We continue this in step 10, though jump to that step if you wish to configure your EC2 instance first.**

## Phase 3: Apply Docker

### 7. Set Up Docker Files

NOTE: Depending on your setup these files may look different

Next, we will delve into setting up the docker files. You may find that when running this locally, you may have to change some things for Production; so for example, locally I set up **RUN npm install -g nodemon** for local container, but this is not needed in Production.

**Client Dockerfile (Next.js):**
Create a file called **Dockerfile** Put this under your client root, so for example: /client/DockerFile

I like to have two Docker files, one for local builds as one for production, which I named **Dockerfile.prod**.

```bash
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy application code and build
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine AS runner

WORKDIR /app

# Set environment to production
ENV NODE_ENV production

# Copy built files
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/tsconfig.json ./tsconfig.json
COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.mjs ./next.config.mjs // Setting this helped for deployment to EC2

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --production

EXPOSE 3000

# Start the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]

```

**Server Dockerfile (Node.js):**
Create a file called **Dockerfile** Put this under your server root, so for example: /server/DockerFile

```bash
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

EXPOSE 4000

# Start the server
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### 8. Set Up Docker Compose

For this purposes we will use docker compose, create a **docker-compose.yml** file in the root:

_If unsure what these steps do, please have a read of the Docker Compose docs or other information online. Your file may differ to this._

```bash

version: "3.9"

services:
  nextjs-app:
    build:
      context: ./client
      dockerfile: Dockerfile // or Dockerfile.prod if you named it that
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET=${NEXTAUTH_SECRET} // Or whatever ENVs you have for your frontend
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}
      - NEXTAUTH_URL=${NEXTAUTH_URL}
    env_file:
      - .env
     networks:
      - app-network

  server:
    build:
      context: ./server
      dockerfile: Dockerfile // or Dockerfile.prod if you named it that
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    environment:
      - API_URL=${API_URL} // Or whatever ENVs you have for your frontend
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - app-network

```

## Phase 4: Deploy

### 9. Create a Deploy Script

This is optional and there are different ways you could do this. For example, you could set up a Github Actions workflow. For this tutorial, have created a **deploy.sh** script to automate updates.

What I like to do on this script is also set my environment variables on here, just make sure that if you do and security is important, then make sure this deploy script is in your **.gitignore** file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

// 1.
EC2_PUBLIC_IP="<PUBLIC_IP>"

set -e

// 2.
cat <<EOF > .env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=my_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://${EC2_PUBLIC_IP}:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://${EC2_PUBLIC_IP}:4000
JWT_SECRET=jwt_secret
API_URL=http://${EC2_PUBLIC_IP}:4000
API_SECRET=some_api_secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://${EC2_PUBLIC_IP}:3000
NODE_ENV=production
EOF

// 3.
if ! git pull origin main; then
    echo "Failed to pull latest changes from git"
    exit 1
fi

// 4.
docker-compose down

docker system prune -f

//5.
if ! docker-compose pull; then
    echo "Failed to pull docker images"
    exit 1
fi

if ! docker-compose up -d --build; then
    echo "Failed to bring up containers"
    exit 1
fi

//6.
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs nextjs-app

echo "Deployment complete!"

```

Overview of the script:

- 1: Get EC2 Public IP

You will need this not only for the env vars but for the deployment further down. Access you instance on AWS EC2 and look for the public IPV4 url, (for example 54.123.12.11) and make a copy. You can also try: this in step 1 instead: **EC2_PUBLIC_IP=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4)**

- 2: Set up your env vars

Set up your env vars, note the use of EC2_PUBLIC_IP here.

- 3: Pull latest commit

I like to pull the latest version of the repo here - we will delve into this in the Deploy phase.

- 4: Docker clean Up
  I like to do a bit of Docker clean here

- 5: Docker build
  You don't need to do error handling here, but I like to just in case.

- 6: Docker logs
  Can also add docker logs if you wish.

- Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh

```

### 10. Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH

Open up a terminal and copy your project files to the EC2 instance.

To do this you will need

- Your key pair you created in step 4.
- Your EC2 Public IP address, you got from the last step.

- SSH into the instance:

```bash
ssh -i my-ec2-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>

```

- Update and install required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose git

```

- Start and enable Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

```

- Log out and log back in for the Docker group permissions to take effect.

**NOTE - You may run into SSH authentication issues, if you do you may need to create a SSH key in your GitHUb.**

### 11. Clone Repository

- Make a copy of the **deploy.sh** script into the folder you are in.
- Make sure your repo is uptodate and in the instance and then clone your repo (hence we do a copy of the script above as your deploy script will not be in repo if in gitignore).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git

```

### 12. Deploy Script and Repo to EC2 Instance

- Exit the instance and then copy your project files to the EC2 instance:

```bash
scp -i my-ec2-key.pem -r ./your-repo ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>:~/your-repo

```

- SSH into the instance again:

```bash
ssh -i my-ec2-key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>

```

### 11. Run Deployment

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd /your-repo

```

- Run the deployment script:

Assuming as you are now in /your_repo and you need to access the script one folder previously, you would use ~

```bash
~/deploy.sh

```

- Verify that the containers are running:

```bash
docker-compose ps

```

### Test your application:

- Client: http://<your-ec2-ip>:3000
- Server: http://<your-ec2-ip>:4000

### Conclusion

You’ve successfully deployed your Next.js and Node.js applications to AWS EC2 using Docker.
This setup ensures a robust and scalable architecture for your project.
